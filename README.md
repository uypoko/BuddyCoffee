## Roadmap

## Prerequisites
* Install Xcode 10.1 or later.
* Install CocoaPods 1.4.0 or later.

If cocoapods has not been installed, run the following command from the terminal.
```bash
$ sudo gem install cocoapods
```
## Installation
### Step 1: Add the Firebase configuration file
  Move the GoogleService-Info.plist file into the root of the BuddyCoffee project.
### Step 2: Install necessary dependencies

Open a terminal and cd to the directory containing the Podfile.
```bash
$ cd <path-to-project>/BuddyCoffee/
```

Run the pod install command. This will install the SDKs specified in the Podspec, along with any dependencies they may have.
```bash
$ pod install
```

### Step 3: Open the app's .xcworkspace file to launch Xcode
